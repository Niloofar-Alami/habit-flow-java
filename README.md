# Daily Focus Evaluator (Java)

A simple Java console application created to practice **control flow concepts**
such as conditional statements, loops, and basic decision-making logic.

This program evaluates daily habits based on user input and generates
a short performance report.

## Features
- User-defined daily habits
- Habit scoring system (0–10)
- Total and average score calculation

## Concepts Practiced
- Control Flow (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- `switch` statement
- Loops
- Arrays
- Methods
- User input handling with `Scanner`

## Purpose
This project is part of my Java learning journey and focuses on
understanding **control flow and decision-based logic** in real-world scenarios.
