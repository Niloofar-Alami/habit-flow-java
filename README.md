# Daily Focus Evaluator

A Java console application designed to evaluate daily performance across multiple habits.  
This project demonstrates the use of methods, arrays, conditional logic, and switch-case structures to build a structured and interactive program.

## Project Overview
The Daily Focus Evaluator allows the user to:
- Enter a list of habits to track
- Rate each habit from 0 to 10
- Receive contextual feedback for each score
- Calculate total and average performance
- Detect critically low scores
- Generate a final performance evaluation report

This project was developed to strengthen my understanding of modular programming and decision-making structures in Java.

## Key Concepts Used
- Methods for organizing program logic  
- Arrays for storing habits and scores  
- Switch-case statements for score-based feedback  
- Conditional logic for performance evaluation  
- Input handling with `Scanner`  
- Loop-based data processing  

## What I Learned
- How to design a multi-step interactive console program  
- How to combine arrays, loops, and conditionals effectively  
- How to implement evaluation logic with both average and individual thresholds  
- How to structure code for readability and maintainability  

## Code Structure
The project is organized into clear, single-purpose methods:
- `printHeader()` – Displays the program header  
- `getHabits()` – Collects habit names  
- `getScores()` – Collects scores and provides feedback  
- `calculateTotal()` – Computes total score  
- `calculateAverage()` – Computes average score  
- `evaluatePerformance()` – Determines performance level based on average and low-score detection  
- `printReport()` – Displays the final summary  

## Future Improvements
- Add input validation for score ranges  
- Add data persistence for daily logs  
- Add weekly/monthly analytics  
- Add color-coded console output  
- Convert the program into a GUI or mobile app  

## How to Run
Compile and run the program using any Java IDE or terminal:
